# osARM

This is a small & unfinished operating system written in C for the Raspberry Pi 3. Its very simple and not usable in any way possible (it doesn't even have a filesystem). Hasn't been tested on anything but qemu. Not useful, so anyone can take any code from it.

greatly inspired from https://wiki.osdev.org/ARM_RaspberryPi_Tutorial_C and https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial. https://wiki.osdev.org/ARM_RaspberryPi is also a good resource for more links.
